# Admin {#admin}

> Admin variable identifier is [ad]

It is the first chapter but actually, administrative variables are quite easy to use.

There is a few logical branching here. If you want to create a country-level variable, you will need to gather back several subvariables including `reporting_region`, (USA are a stand alone in this variable) `european_countries`, `african_countries`, `asian_countries`, `australia_countries`. These variables are mutually exclusive (except for reporting_region).

Useful when you want to draw the world map of contributing countries.

Please look at the [contributors and contributing centers](#contrib) section for more details.
