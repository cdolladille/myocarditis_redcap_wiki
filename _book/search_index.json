"],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introducing the database 2.1 What is in the Redcap? 2.2 Variables naming rules 2.3 Data structure 2.4 Multi-instrument variables 2.5 Root variables", " Chapter 2 Introducing the database This is a VERY brief introduction. The database was created in 2018, and gather more than 700 cases of immune checkpoint inhibitors associated cardiovascular adverse reactions (as of September 2022). Cases are reported from all around the world, and most of them are myocarditis cases. October 2022 update. It was decided to remove all non-myocarditis cases from the base. Some cases were removed after a careful semi-automated review, which also tracked duplicates. If your not familiar with the Redcap data structure and how data can be exported, you should look at the Redcap Help &amp; FAQ. We will not deal with these concepts here. 2.1 What is in the Redcap? In the Redcap you may find an extensive characterization of the cases, including clinical work-up and outcomes. These features are grouped according to time points (baseline, index date, follow-up…) or critical exams (EKG, biopsy…) that are called instruments in Redcap. Each instrument is described in a separate chapter in this document. 2.2 Variables naming rules Variable names are attributed according to standardized rules as follow: A variable name always starts by the instrument identifier (e.g. p_ for demographic data, see below Data structure), with the exception of date date_and time ti_ variables (see multi-instrument variables). In case an instrument is subdivided into multiple instruments, the instrument identifier is followed by the subinstrument identifier (e.g. ic_ca for index cardiotoxicity cancer treatment) Calculated vars have the same name as manual vars, with an additional suffix __c. Free text vars have the same name as their branching logic displayer, with an additional suffix __ft. Descriptive vars have the same name as their branching logic displayer, with an additional suffix __desc. Note that these vars do not contain any data and are not usually exported. All variables names are lower case, with words separated by underscores (e.g. you will not see upper case vars such as AGE_VAR). This is also known as snake_case format. As much as possible, we use singular rather than plural in the names (e.g. antimetabolite rather than antimetabolites) Variables with the __old suffix are former versions that will be integrated in v3 of the database. They contain the same type of information, but often have different levels (e.g. an additional “missing” level). We translate here a general description of the variables. To get a precise definition of a variable, you will be more inspired looking at the Redcap’s codebook. Please note this document is NOT an exhaustive list of the variables in the redcap and is not intended to be. 2.3 Data structure The Redcap instruments are: Instrument Identifier Description Admin [ad] Identify the reporting source, the reporter, with mailing contact information. Demographics [p] Patient demographics (age, sex…), medical history (including cardiovascular history), and medications. Baseline EKG [be] If any, description of a baseline Electrocardiogram (prior to cardiotoxicity). Previous line [pl] Features of prior anticancer treatments, including those of older cancers and the current cancer in prior lines of treatment. Current line [cl] Features of the current line of anticancer treatment containing immunotherapy(ies). Also, features of the current cancer (actively treated). Index cardiotoxicity [ic] All clinical work-up of the patient when presenting for cardiotoxicity. This is the main instrument. Index EKG [ie] It is an instrument by itself, as it gathers one or several EKGs, hence there is a large quantity of data here. Index hospitalization [ih] Features that occurred during the hospitalization that followed cardiotoxicity diagnosis. Follow-up [fu] Long term outcomes. Biology [b All biological features (transversal instrument) 2.4 Multi-instrument variables Sometime, an event can occur at different times. For example, a patient can experience death during its index hospitalization, or later in follow-up. To ensure a proper identification of events according to the research purpose, a separate chapter is dedicated to theses variables including timings. 2.5 Root variables When a question can have multiple non-exclusive answers, the Field Type in Redcap is “checklist”. For example: which alkylating agent(s) was(were) used? Cisplatin Carboplatin Suppose the dots are checkboxes and you may select either of them. In this case, Redcap creates subvariables in the data extraction. If the variable name is p_pl_alkylating_agent, then you will NOT find it in the extraction. You will have 2 subvariables named p_pl_alkylating_agent___1 and p_pl_alkylating_agent___2. Root variables are those variables that are splitted into multiple subvariables, i.e. which have the Field Type argument “checkbox”. You may want to merge back these variables together, to create a global variable: “Has the patient been treated with any alkylating agent?”. "],["admin.html", "Chapter 3 Admin", " Chapter 3 Admin Admin variable identifier is [ad] It is the first chapter but actually, administrative variables are quite easy to use. There is a few logical branching here. If you want to create a country-level variable, you will need to gather back several subvariables including reporting_region, (USA are a stand alone in this variable) european_countries, african_countries, asian_countries, australia_countries. These variables are mutually exclusive (except for reporting_region). Useful when you want to draw the world map of contributing countries. Please look at the contributors and contributing centers section for more details.

For example, if you have two checkboxes for medications Beta-blockers Aspirin And say the first is checked and the second is not. In this case, its easy to say the patient is taking betablockers, but what about aspirin? Maybe the patient is not taking aspirin, or maybe data is missing and the user did not checked the box. This could be the case if a patient addressed to the hospital forgets to bring his/her prescription and do not remember precisely the name of the medications. On the other hand, you may often retrieve the complete list by calling the pharmacist or if a related finally brings the prescription during the hospital stay. It is assumed that medication list is complete (no missing data) if the p_meds_any variable is checked.

As a result, 2 variables contain the same data. They are not mutually exclusive, which means an observation can have a value for the 2 variables (e.g. the user provided both dates, which allows for automated computation in the calculated var, and also entered age in the manual var free text variable). There has to be a rule of thumb to choose which variable is to be used in the analysis. Here is ours: Calculated vars are preferred over manual vars This means that, for a single case: If the calculated var is available, it will be retained. Else, if the manual var is available, it will be retained. Else, if none are available, the value is missing. Here is an implementation of this simple logic into an R function numvar_uni &lt;- # Numeric variables unifier function( # used to organize data entered from 2 variables, currently its a prioritization var1, # a quasi quoted name of column from data. Usually, one is the calculated var, one is the manual var, var1 will be prioritize over var2 var2 # also a quasi quoted name # underlying data.frame data argument is omitted ){ var1 &lt;- rlang::enexpr(var1) var2 &lt;- rlang::enexpr(var2) ex &lt;- rlang::expr(dplyr::case_when( !is.na(!!var1) ~ as.numeric(!!var1), !is.na(!!var2) ~ as.numeric(!!var2), TRUE ~ NA_real_ )) ex } 9.2 Calculated and manual vars identifiers For a manual var, the associated calculated var has the __c suffix. Example: manual var calculated var p_age (patient age, from instrument admin) p_age__c 9.3 Free text variables Users are often provided additional fields in the case their patient falls out of the checkboxes. For example, a patient may have experienced an auto-immune disease that is not listed in the p_ai_ vars. In this case, the user can check the p_ai_other box. When this box is checked, the p_ai_other__ft variable is displayed. It is a free text field where the user can input additional data (e.g. Bullous pemphigoid). Free text vars have the same name as the branching logic displayer, with a __ft suffix. At the moment, data from free text variables is not used to compute additional variables for 2 main reasons: There are few data in these vars Data quality checking requires additional time consuming ressources that cannot be applied to a general framework We recommend you use free text variables only if their data closely match your research question. 9.4 Sex At this stage, it is a binary variable with value 1 for man 2 for woman It is usually easier to use a variable named “man” or “woman”, built from the sex variable, to remember how to interprate model results. "],["multi_instrument_var.html", "Chapter 10 Multi-instrument variables 10.1 Date and time variables 10.2 Time to cardiotoxicity onset from immune checkpoint inhibitor introduction 10.3 Death 10.4 Electrocardiograms", " Chapter 10 Multi-instrument variables 10.1 Date and time variables As dates and times are used across instruments to capture delays between an event and another (e.g. between index cardiotoxicity and death), there are attributed a specific naming scheme: They do not start by the instrument identifier They have their own identifier date for dates and ti for times. Time variables always have 3 components: The ti identifier The first event identifier The second event identifier There is an exception to this naming rule: time between 2 cures of ICI (either previous line or current line), which has the long suffix regimen_freq. For example, time between index cardiotoxicity and death is ti_ic_death. An event identifier can have a middle _ if its very long (e.g. cl1stctla4_other for current line first dose of an unspecified anti-CTLA4, although this is quite a rare case. Time variables represent delays between two dates. Of note, times can be expressed in days, weeks or years. var instrument unit quick desc ti_tobaccoquit_ic demo years From tobacco quitting to IC ti_otx_ic demo years From organ transplant x to IC ti_plicistop_ic demo days From previous line ICI stop (end of regimen) to IC pl_drug_regimen_freq previous_line weeks From one cure to another, during an ICI therapy regimen ti_ic_1ststeroid ic days From IC to first dose of steroids ti_cl1stnivo_ic cl days From current line ICI-drug 1st infusion to IC ti_ic_ihdischarge ih days Length of hospital stay 10.2 Time to cardiotoxicity onset from immune checkpoint inhibitor introduction As the title suggests, the idea is to collect the time to onset between the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitor received during the current cycle and the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. This data is stored at the immune checkpoint inhibitor level, e.g., a patient who received nivolumab will have this data stored in a nivolumab specific variable. The structure for this data is Current Target Description start_days_drug ti_icistart_ic_drug It is a delay, in days. Drug name is abbreviated here in the current naming (e.g. nivo for nivolumab). Sometimes, the drug name is wrong (see below) Could be : time variable (ti_) from (ici_start) to index cardiotoxicity (ic), for drug (drug complete name) start_days_drugx ti_icistart_ic_drug__calc Same but computed from dates (when available). Mind the “x” at the end of the name Could be: same but with a standardized suffix indicating a calculation first_doses_drug_mce Drug name is complete here. It is an old variable which has now the \\@ HIDDEN status, and is similar to start_days_drugx To capture this time to onset, you have to check every possibilities for a patient, e.g. you must check for all immune checkpoint inhibitor level time variables and choose which of these 3 variables you keep first, if ever more than one is available. This gives a quite heavy piece of code ti_icistart_ic = expr(pmax( # pmax here: maximum delay (in the case multiple ICI were prescribed sequentially) eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_nivo, start_days_nivox, first_doses_nivolumab_mce)), # identical to start_days_nivox but it is @HIDDEN eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_pem, start_days_pemx, first_doses_pembrolizumab_mce)), # @HIDDEN eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_pem_2, # Other Anti-PD1 regimen start_days_pem_2x, first_doses_pembrolizumab_mce_2)),# @HIDDEN eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_pem_3, # Cemiplimab start_days_pem_3x, first_doses_pembrolizumab_mce_3)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_atez, start_days_atezx, first_doses_atezolizumab_mce)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_ave, start_days_avex, first_doses_avelumab_mce)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_durv, start_days_durvx, first_doses_durvalumab_mce)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_durv_3,# Ohter Anti-PDL1 start_days_durv_3x, first_doses_durvalumab_mce_3)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_ipi, start_days_ipix, first_doses_ipilimumab_mce)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_trem, start_days_tremx, first_doses_tremelimumab_mce)), eval(tto_uni_3v(start_days_trem_2, # Other Anti-CTLA4 start_days_trem_2x, first_doses_tremelimumab_mce_2)), na.rm = TRUE ) - # look at the minus!! Shall we keep it? 2022-09-16 eval(numvar_uni(cardiotox_days_1, cardiotox_days_1x)) # Number of days before presentation that Myocarditis symptoms began ) Where eval(tto_univ_3v()) would be a prioritizer function among the 3 variables.
